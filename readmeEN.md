# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game. A random number is selected for the player to guess. The player needs to guess the number correctly. The game is designed to run in a web browser and developed using pure JavaScript.

## Game Rules

1. When the game starts, a random number is selected and not revealed to the player.
2. There is an input box for the player to enter their guess.
3. When the player enters a guess, the guess count is incremented, and the player is informed if their guess is correct or not.
4. If the player's guess is correct, the game ends, and the total guess count is shown to the player.
5. If the player's guess is incorrect, the player is informed whether their guess is too high or too low, and they are prompted to make another guess.
6. The player continues from step 4 to step 5 until they make the correct guess.
